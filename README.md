# static-transfer-learning

This project contains a Dockerized web service that: 

1. constructs a transfer-learning model based on a set of (image,label) pairs, and 
2. labels images based on the constructed model

The model is produced deterministically. Cryptographic hashes are produced for all inputs and outputs to ensure reproducibility and auditability.

## Motivation

When building a machine-learning system, researchers often allocate more attention to:

1. the novelty of methods employed, and
2. the performance of the system on a benchmark, than they do to (3) reproducibility of results

While this is the fastest way to publish results, the trade-off is that the productivity of the research community as a whole is reduced, as peers are unable to reproduce and assess one another's findings. 

Even more troubling is that systems built without reproducibility in mind are sometimes deployed to production environments. Business decisions are made based on ML system outputs, but results of decisions are inconsistent across trials because the ML systems are non-deterministic.

Non-determinism enters ML systems in at least two ways:

1. system initialization conditions aren't documented, and 
2. systems incorporate sources of randomness as part of their initialization process

This project demonstrates the utility of an ML system in which randomness is excluded from the build process.

## Quick Start

    docker-compose up -d
    
Please open Swagger by http://localhost:8080/api/doc

## Rest API

### Train mode

    POST /train
    
Example:
```sh
$ cat in.json 
{"csv_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/some-bucket/some.csv"}
$ Y=`cat in.json`; curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: text/plain' -d "$Y" http://localhost:8080/train
{"model_name": "18e5194e577513e7e60db6af9e07c58a6bbef4c8", "status": "new"}

# you can continue to issue the same command while training happens. you'll get an "in_progress" response.
$ !!
{"model_name": "18e5194e577513e7e60db6af9e07c58a6bbef4c8", "status": "in_progress"}

# eventually it finishes training.
$ !!
{"model_name": "18e5194e577513e7e60db6af9e07c58a6bbef4c8", "status": "ready"}
```

#### Arguments
**csv_url** - URL of CSV file in format:

```csv
<image_url>,<label>
```

Example:
```csv
http://tf-models.arilot.org/static-tf-models/img/Abstract-Patterned_Blouse/img_00000049.jpg,blouse
http://tf-models.arilot.org/static-tf-models/img/Abstract-Stripe_Fuzzy_Sweater/img_00000011.jpg,sweater
```

**model_url** - URL for save model file into Persistence Storage, like GCS or IPFS (no supported)

Examples:
```
gs://my-bucket/my-model                                         # Google cloud storage (not supported)
ipfs://QmYwAPJzv5CZsnA625s3Xf2nemtYgPpHdWEz79ojWnPbdG/my-model  # IPFS (not supported)
``` 

#### Response

Rest API will response JSON, like

```json
{
  "model_name": "fe2199d0b79a2fe27c83c726e7b4307e1a066c02",
  "status": "ready",
}
```

**model_name** - SHA1 hash, based on CSV file URL

**status** - model status.

##### Available statuses

* **new** - Model does not exist locally and need to build
* **in_progress** - Model building process in progress
* **ready** - Model is built and ready to use

### Inference mode

    POST /inference

#### Arguments
**image_url** - URL of Image

**model_url** - Model name (from train mode response) or model URL (like GCS or IPFS) (no supported)

Examples:

```
fe2199d0b79a2fe27c83c726e7b4307e1a066c02                        # Local model
local://fe2199d0b79a2fe27c83c726e7b4307e1a066c02                # Local model example #2
gs://my-bucket/my-model                                         # Google cloud storage (not supported)
ipfs://QmYwAPJzv5CZsnA625s3Xf2nemtYgPpHdWEz79ojWnPbdG/my-model  # IPFS (not supported)
```

#### Response

Predict result per label.

Example:

```json
{
  "blouse": 0.66,
  "halter": 0.0,
  "sweater": 0.34,
}
```
