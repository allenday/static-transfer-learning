# static-transfer-learning

This project contains a Dockerized web service that: 

1. constructs a transfer-learning model based on a set of (image,label) pairs, and 
2. labels images based on the constructed model

The model is produced deterministically. Cryptographic hashes are produced for all inputs and outputs to ensure reproducibility and auditability.

## Motivation

When building a machine-learning system, researchers often allocate more attention to:

1. the novelty of methods employed, and
2. the performance of the system on a benchmark, than they do to (3) reproducibility of results

While this is the fastest way to publish results, the trade-off is that the productivity of the research community as a whole is reduced, as peers are unable to reproduce and assess one another's findings. 

Even more troubling is that systems built without reproducibility in mind are sometimes deployed to production environments. Business decisions are made based on ML system outputs, but results of decisions are inconsistent across trials because the ML systems are non-deterministic.

Non-determinism enters ML systems in at least two ways:

1. system initialization conditions aren't documented, and 
2. systems incorporate sources of randomness as part of their initialization process

This project demonstrates the utility of an ML system in which randomness is excluded from the build process.

## Quick Start

### Run self-hosted

    docker-compose up -d --build
    
Please open Swagger by http://localhost:8080/api/doc

## Rest API

### Train mode

    POST /train
    
Example:
```sh
# Input has two parameters. csv_url, and model_uri. These are described below.
$ cat example-data/train.json 
{
  "metadata": {
    "random_seed": 1234
  },
  "model": {
    "uri": "gs://test/1"
  },
  "csv": {
    "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allenday/static-transfer-learning/master/example-data/train.csv",
    "sha1": "fb2a7a2949330454364767ec393b4b62176b2335"
  }
}

$ TRAIN=`cat example-data/train.json`; curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: text/plain' -d "$TRAIN" http://localhost:8080/train
{"model_sha1": "9474ef2130cf215dd9892decba8e0d973fc2f003", "status": "new"}

# You can continue to issue the same command while training happens. you'll get an "in_progress" response.
$ !!
{"model_sha1": "9474ef2130cf215dd9892decba8e0d973fc2f003", "status": "in_progress"}

# Eventually it finishes training.
$ !!

```

#### Arguments

ipfs://QmYwAPJzv5CZsnA625s3Xf2nemtYgPpHdWEz79ojWnPbdG/my-model  # IPFS (not supported)
``` 

#### Response

Rest API will response JSON, like

```json
{
  "model_sha1": "9474ef2130cf215dd9892decba8e0d973fc2f003",
  "status": "ready",
}
```

**model_sha1** - SHA1 hash, based on CSV file URL and model meta parameters

**status** - model status.

##### Available statuses

* **new** - Model does not exist locally and need to build
* **in_progress** - Model building process in progress
* **ready** - Model is built and ready to use
* **error** - Some error on data downloading / model training

    POST /infer

Example:
```sh
# Use model_uri from /train
$ cat example-data/infer.json
